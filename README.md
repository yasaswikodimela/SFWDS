The Smart Food Waste Reduction and Donation System  is a Java-based application built using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It connects food donors, NGOs, and volunteers through an automated platform. The system allows donors to register available food, assigns volunteers dynamically, and tracks real-time pickups using multithreading.
